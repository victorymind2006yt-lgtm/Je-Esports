# Firebase Index Required

You encountered a "The query requires an index" error. This is normal when adding new sorting/filtering capabilities.

## How to Fix

1. **Click the Link**: The error message gave you a long link starting with `https://console.firebase.google.com/...`.
   - **Click that link**.
   - It will open your Firebase Console.
   - Click the **"Create Index"** button.
   - Wait a few minutes (it will say "Building").

2. **Once the index status is "Enabled"**, refresh your app. The dashboard will load correctly.

## Why this happened
We added a feature to show "Tournaments Joined" on your dashboard. This requires searching the `registrations` collection by `userId` and sorting by `registrationTime`. Firestore requires a specific index for this combination to ensure it stays fast.
